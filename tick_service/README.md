# Tick Service

The **Tick Service** module provides core functionality for managing periodic updates ("ticks") within the Ryzom Core framework. It is responsible for coordinating time-based events and synchronizing state across different components of the game server.

## Key Components

- **tick_service.cpp / tick_service.h**  
  Implements the main tick service logic, handling tick events and managing the tick loop.

- **range_mirror_manager.cpp / range_mirror_manager.h**  
  Manages range-based state mirroring, ensuring that relevant data is synchronized efficiently between server and clients or between different server components.

## Usage

Include the Tick Service in your server build to enable time-based event processing and efficient state synchronization.

## Integration

The Tick Service is designed to be used as part of the Ryzom Core server architecture and integrates with other game services through standard interfaces.
