# Ryzom Backup Service

This directory contains the Backup Service modules for the Ryzom server. The Backup Service is responsible for managing the backup and restoration of server data, ensuring data integrity and availability for recovery operations.

## Structure

- **backup_file_access.cpp/h**: Handles low-level file operations for reading and writing backup data.
- **backup_service.cpp/h**: Core logic for managing backup processes, scheduling, and coordination.
- **backup_service_mod.cpp**: Module integration for the backup service within the server ecosystem.
- **commands.cpp**: Implements command handling for backup and restore operations.
- **web_connection.cpp/h**: Manages web-based connections for remote backup control or status reporting.

## Features

- Automated and manual backup of server data
- File access and management for backup storage
- Command-based interface for triggering backup and restore operations
- Web connection support for remote monitoring or control

## Kubernetes Considerations

For a Kubernetes (k8s) deployment, much of the backup scheduling, storage management, and remote access could be handled by k8s-native tools (such as PersistentVolume backups, CronJobs, or external backup operators). However, you may need to retain or adapt:

- **Game-specific backup logic:** Any custom serialization, data integrity checks, or Ryzom-specific backup/restore procedures in `backup_file_access` and `backup_service`.
- **Command and API integration:** If in-game tools or admin UIs rely on the backup service's command interface or web endpoints, these should be preserved or reimplemented as k8s-compatible services or APIs.

The Backup Service ensures reliable data protection for Ryzom servers and may require adaptation to fit into a Kubernetes-native backup
